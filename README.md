### Dataset
- Dataset that was provided in class from the powerpoints, for 130 hospitals, containing records for patients diagnosed with diabetes 
- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008

### Markdown
- I chose the variables "number_diagnoses" and "num_medications", from what I could assess, the "number_diagnoses" seemed like the independent variable and the "num medications" seemed like the dependent variable.
- At first I was unable to perform the Shapiro test, I had to look up "from scipy.stats import shapiro" to import and perform the function
- I was having difficulty with properly attributing values due to typos
